# Silicone Market
A simple e-commerce website (about pc components) that uses Next.js in the front end (it makes routing easier don't judge me) and apollo in the backend for GraphQL.

## Goal:
I just wanted to learn how graphql works and how to set it up, I was going to integrate stripe but then I realized it's useless.

## Tech I used:
- Next.js
- TailwindCSS
- Shadcn/ui
- Prisma.io (easier db management)
- Apollo
- Graphql

## Where is the demo?
Bro I'm broke (pls hire me)

## Peace
